Code Samples

It's hard to write projects - and it's important to be able to find reference code to be able to refer to. Here are a list of resources around that you can use to be able to help implement your project:

* `oneAPI Code Samples <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples>`_ - a repository by Intel with a number of code samples that you can build and use using the DPC++ compiler.
  `oneAPI `
  `ComputeCPP code samples <https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/computecpp-sdk>_` - repository from Codeplay with code samples for their ComputeCPP implementation of SYCL.
